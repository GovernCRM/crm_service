# CRM Service

The CRM service allows for management of contacts and appointments with users of the application.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

You must have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

### Build & run service locally

Build the Docker image:

```bash
docker-compose build
```

Run a web server with this service:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

Now, open your browser and go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

For the admin panel, go to [http://localhost:8080/admin](http://localhost:8080/admin)
(user: `admin`, password: `admin`).

### Run tests

To run the tests once:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint 'bash scripts/run-tests.sh' {name-of-service}
```

To run the tests and leave bash open inside the container so that it's possible to
re-run the tests faster again using `bash scripts/run-tests.sh [--keepdb]`:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint 'bash scripts/run-tests.sh --bash-on-finish' {name-of-service}
```

To run bash:

```bash
docker-compose run --rm --entrypoint 'bash' {name-of-service}
```
